Hello this is Aghilan
I Shall explain what is happening through this note pad
1) I cloned my repository using GIT CLONE
2) Then I was trying to create a txt file but I thought  I messed up on
     something so i used GIT RESET --HARD 
3) Now i have used GIT ADD Task-3  to stage my work
4)Here u could see that i have used GIT COMMIT to save my changes
5) I noticed that my file was unstaged...I dont know why i tried to use 
    GIT COMMIT-A but that opened up the vimeditor..I dont know
   what to do so i just check the status ...(GIT COMMIT RAN 
   SUCCESSFULLY)
6) Here i have used GIT PUSH ORIGIN MAIN  to push everything into
    my repository it opened a new tab for logging in
7)I have cleared the screen and i noticed that my file was not staged so
   i use again GIT ADD . to stage my all files and checked to be green
8) After ton of asking and changing....now i have created branches 
and pushed my files ...
9) OK now we are gonna do ...... this edit has been done 
 in the branch testbranch2. You will be able to see this changes in main 
 branch soon after merging
